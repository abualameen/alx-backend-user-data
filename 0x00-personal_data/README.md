# Personal Data Protection with Python

## Overview
This project focuses on implementing techniques to protect personally identifiable information (PII) in Python applications. It covers topics such as obfuscating PII fields in log messages, encrypting passwords, checking password validity, and authenticating to a database using environment variables.

## Examples of Personally Identifiable Information (PII)
Personally identifiable information (PII) refers to any data that can be used to identify a specific individual. Common examples of PII include:
- Full name
- Email address
- Social security number
- Date of birth
- Address
- Phone number

## How to Implement a Log Filter to Obfuscate PII Fields
To obfuscate PII fields in log messages, a log filter can be implemented using Python. The provided `filtered_logger.py` module contains a function called `filter_datum` that performs this task. This function takes a list of fields to obfuscate, a redaction string, the log message, and a separator character as input. It utilizes regular expressions to replace occurrences of certain field values with the redaction string, thus ensuring sensitive information is masked in log files.

## How to Encrypt a Password and Check Its Validity
Password encryption is crucial for safeguarding user credentials in a system. In Python, passwords can be encrypted using hashing algorithms such as bcrypt. Additionally, it's essential to implement password validation mechanisms to ensure the security of user accounts. Techniques like salting and pepper can enhance password security by adding random data to the encryption process.

## How to Authenticate to a Database Using Environment Variables
Authentication to a database involves securely managing credentials to access database resources. One best practice is to use environment variables to store sensitive information like database usernames and passwords. This approach helps prevent hardcoded credentials from being exposed in source code or configuration files. By reading environment variables at runtime, applications can securely authenticate to databases without compromising security.
